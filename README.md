# The Ferrum Programming Language

## Important!
This language is a work in progress. The ideas & implementations are still being prototyped. The language, as specified in this file, is not yet finished or fleshed out.

## What is this?

Ferrum is meant to be a simplified, batteries-included rust-like programming language, for high-level software development.

The goal of the language is to make high-performance high-level software development easier & safer. This goal is achieved by providing a trimmed-down rust-like language, with strong opinions and a fully-featured library.

Details of the language are not yet well documented. But until then, enjoy the Hello World!

```rust
use fe::print

fn main()
    print("Hello, World!")
;
```
